# MicroPython VS10xx Drumkit

A minimalistic test / approach to try operating a VS10xx module in real time MIDI mode.
An example for Arduino can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/microtherion/2636608).

Based on my VS10xx port [here](https://github.com/KateiRen/vs10xx-micropython), methods to activate MIDI and send notes need to be added.
